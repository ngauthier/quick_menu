QuickMenu
=========

QuickMenu was designed to allow a user to quickly create a javascript drop down menu from a
set of existing links. This menu can then by stylized using CSS.

Tested in IE6 (windows), Firefox 2 and 3 (windows and linux), and Safari (windows).

*** When you install this plugin, make sure to copy the css and js files to the public/stylesheets
and public/javascripts folders. ***

Example
=======

Let's say you used to have this in your app/views/people/index.html.erb:

<% for person in @people -%>
  <%= Person.name %>
  <%= link_to 'Edit', edit_people_path(person) %>
  <%= link_to 'Show', people_path(person) %>
<% end -%>


With quick menu, it changes to this:

<% for person in @people -%>
  <%= person.name %>
  <% links = [] -%>
  <% links.push(link_to 'Edit', edit_people_path(person)) %>
  <% links.push(link_to 'Show', people_path(person)) %>
  <%= quick_menu(:title => 'Actions', :identifier => person.id.to_s, :links => links) %>
<% end -%>

Notice that the "=" is removed from the link_to lines because they aren't being rendered, they are
being added to the links array.

The "identifier" param lets you decide how to identify the span created by quick menu. This is so
that they have different IDs, so when you hover one menu, they don't all go.

The best part is, look how little editing you have to do for each link! Just remove the = and add
links.push( ... ).
